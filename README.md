Sensor Data Accumulator
================

This is an Android application that collects sensor data from the micromechanical mechanisms (accelerometer and gyroscope) located within the mobile. Moreover, sensor data is synchronized with the mobile browser (URL) in real-time so that it can be stored (SQLite database) for a posteriori analysis which involves applying multiple data mining techniques.
